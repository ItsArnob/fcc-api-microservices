# [File metadata microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice)

Heya! this is where the source code for my fcc APIs and microservices certification projects are hosted.

Each project has their respective branch, to try them out locally just clone this repo and switch to the branch project you wish to try.

Make sure you have nodejs v14 or up installed.

Oh and also dont forget to set the `PORT` environment variable! and run the following:

```bash 

npm install

```

```bash 

node index.js

```
